# JavaScript Learning Vault 📚💻

Welcome to my JavaScript Learning Vault!  
This repository is a personal archive of my JavaScript learning journey. From basic syntax to advanced logic, I’ve documented everything here.

## 📂 Folder Structure

- `web1` → Getting started with JavaScript (basics, syntax)

- `...` → Intermediate topics (functions, arrays, objects)
- `...` and beyond → Advanced concepts, mini-projects, and real-world use cases
- `web∞` → The journey never stops!

> The higher the folder number, the more advanced the content!

## 🛠️ What You'll Find
- ✅ Learn and save my codes in a different folder for each class or project
